Webpack 4 project starter with Pug, Sass/Stylus, jQuery, Babel and Yarn
===================

I got this starter pack from here: https://github.com/SoldierCorp/webpack-starter-pug-sass-es6-jquery

Warning
========
Let me warn you however, before you download the files as zip from the above repo:
 - not all files get downloaded as zip (couple of config files are missing)
 - you will have to run 'yarn install' and when you do, you will need to downgrade your node version to less than 9
 (I used node@8)
 - you will also have to edit that path of the files imported and required in app.js


After you have taken care of the warnings, just run 'yarn run dev'. Happy coding!


## Technologies used

- Templating: `Pug`
- Styling: `Sass` *but you can also use stylus*
- Scripting: `jQuery or plain Javascript`
- JS Compiler: `Babel ES6`

## Features

- Well organized folder structure for view, styles and assets.
- Webpack notifier on every compilation.
- Compatibility with `manifest`, `browserconfig` and other external files you wish to include.
- `Babel module resolver` configured to use alias and simplify the paths you need to import.
- `Editorconfig`
- Yarn instead NPM
- PostCSS
